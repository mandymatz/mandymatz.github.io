<h1>Greetings!</h1>

<p>I am a collaborative, solutions-minded ISTQB-CTFL software tester with a drive for continuous improvement. I have worked within the Software Development Life-cycle as a Quality Assurance Analyst for over three years.</p>

<p>I am highly skilled in writing and executing manual test suites and performing requirements analysis. I am a strong client-facing communicator with the ability to discuss technical information with both technical and non-technical personnel. Additionally, I am able to balance technical issues/solutions with time, cost, and human factors.<p>

<p>Quality software and inclusive technologies are my passions. I'm a firm believer that accessibility should be a part of every stage of software development.</p>

<p>I am available remotely, or within the city of Wausau, WI.
</p>
